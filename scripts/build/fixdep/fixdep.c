/*
 * "Optimize" a list of dependencies as spit out by gcc -MD

 *
 * Introduction:
 *
 * gcc produces a very nice and correct list of dependencies which
 * tells make when to remake a file.
 *
 * To use this list as-is however has the drawback that virtually
 * every file in the kernel includes autoconf.h.
 *
 * If the user re-runs make *config, autoconf.h will be
 * regenerated.  make notices that and will rebuild every file which
 * includes autoconf.h, i.e. basically all files. This is extremely
 * annoying if the user just changed CONFIG_HIS_DRIVER from n to m.
 *
 * So we play the same trick that "mkdep" played before. We replace
 * the dependency on autoconf.h by a dependency on every config
 * option which is mentioned in any of the listed prequisites.
 *
 * kconfig populates a tree in include/config/ with an empty file
 * for each config symbol and when the configuration is updated
 * the files representing changed config options are touched
 * which then let make pick up the changes and the files that use
 * the config symbols are rebuilt.
 *
 * So if the user changes his CONFIG_HIS_DRIVER option, only the objects
 * which depend on "include/linux/config/his/driver.h" will be rebuilt,
 * so most likely only his driver ;-)
 *
 * The idea above dates, by the way, back to Michael E Chastain, AFAIK.
 *
 * So to get dependencies right, there are two issues:
 * o if any of the files the compiler read changed, we need to rebuild
 * o if the command line given to the compile the file changed, we
 *   better rebuild as well.
 *
 * The former is handled by using the -MD output, the later by saving
 * the command line used to compile the old object and comparing it
 * to the one we would now use.
 *
 * Again, also this idea is pretty old and has been discussed on
 * kbuild-devel a long time ago. I don't have a sensibly working
 * internet connection right now, so I rather don't mention names
 * without double checking.
 *
 * This code here has been based partially based on mkdep.c, which
 * says the following about its history:
 *
 *   Copyright abandoned, Michael Chastain, <mailto:mec@shout.net>.
 *   This is a C version of syncdep.pl by Werner Almesberger.
 *
 *
 * It is invoked as
 *
 *   fixdep <depfile> <target> <cmdline>
 *
 * and will read the dependency file <depfile>
 *
 * The transformed dependency snipped is written to stdout.
 *
 * It first generates a line
 *
 *   cmd_<target> = <cmdline>
 *
 * and then basically copies the .<target>.d file to stdout, in the
 * process filtering out the dependency on autoconf.h and adding
 * dependencies on include/config/my/option.h for every
 * CONFIG_MY_OPTION encountered in any of the prequisites.
 *
 * It will also filter out all the dependencies on *.ver. We need
 * to make sure that the generated version checksum are globally up
 * to date before even starting the recursive build, so it's too late
 * at this point anyway.
 *
 * The algorithm to grep for "CONFIG_..." is bit unusual, but should
 * be fast ;-) We don't even try to really parse the header files, but
 * merely grep, i.e. if CONFIG_FOO is mentioned in a comment, it will
 * be picked up as well. It's not a problem with respect to
 * correctness, since that can only give too many dependencies, thus
 * we cannot miss a rebuild. Since people tend to not mention totally
 * unrelated CONFIG_ options all over the place, it's not an
 * efficiency problem either.
 *
 *(Note: it'd be easy to port over the complete mkdep state machine,
 *  but I don't think the added complexity is worth it)
 */
/*
 * Note 2: if somebody writes HELLO_CONFIG_BOOM in a file, it will depend onto
 * CONFIG_BOOM. This could seem a bug(not too hard to fix), but please do not
 * fix it! Some UserModeLinux files(look at arch/um/) call CONFIG_BOOM as
 * UML_CONFIG_BOOM, to avoid conflicts with /usr/include/linux/autoconf.h,
 * through arch/um/include/uml-config.h; this fixdep "bug" makes sure that
 * those files will have correct dependencies.
 *
 * Note by Jan Nowotsch:
 * 	This code has been borrowed from the linux kernel build system.
